# Privacy policy for UserPFP

### By using UserPFP you agree to following privacy policy:

UserPFP needs to collect the minimum data to identify which account a submitted picture belongs to (For Discord this is the user ID). This identifying information is displayed publicly and paired with a link to the image that user submitted at ./source/data.json. 

That information is then used to generate a CSS file using ./source/template.css into ./import.css, which is distributed to all theme file users. Otherwise the ./source/data.json file is used to directly apply the images.

---
Changes to this policy may happen at any time, which, if the change is relevant, will be publicly displayed in the annoucement channel on our Discord Server (See README.md). 

("Relevant" in this case means that we do not have to post an update for changes that don't affect the meaning of this document, like spelling corrections or slight rewordings.)
