# Terms of Service for UserPFP

By using UserPFP you agree to following rules:

1. You are not allowed to share content that is unsuitable for minors (No porn, no gore, no violence, no embracing drug abuse etc.).

2. You are not allowed to attempt to circumvent protective measures we have created (Don't bypass user verification).

3. You are not allowed to insult, harass or otherwise disturb other users or team members.

4. Those rules do not apply if you are the user "kass" (User ID: 883815804683030539).
---
Our team (See README.md) decides on a case by case basis and is permitted to take any measures to anyone without directly providing reasoning to the benefit of the community, a team member and/or specific person. 

(This is to provide a solution for any wrongdoings not caught by the written rules)

---
Changes to these terms of service may happen at any time, which, if the change is relevant, will be publicly displayed in the annoucement channel on our Discord Server (See README.md). 

("Relevant" in this case means that we do not have to post an update for changes that don't affect the meaning of this document, like spelling corrections or slight rewordings.)
